Version 2.1.0 has been published to Stable tModLoader v2025.2

⚙️ 功能优化：
✅ 攻击动画判断：现在模组在切换鞭子之前会检查 itemAnimation 和 itemTime，确保当前攻击动作已完成，避免中断鞭子动画。

✅ 输出更加平衡：防止在一段攻击动画内连续切鞭造成的攻击重叠，DPS 表现更加合理稳定。

🐞 修复内容：
修复切鞭会打断攻击并造成异常高伤害的问题。

修复副鞭 Buff 尚未生效时就切回主鞭的问题。

--------------------------------------------------------

⚙️ Improvements:
✅ Attack Animation Awareness: The mod now checks itemAnimation and itemTime before switching whips to ensure the current attack has finished. This prevents interrupting whip animations.

✅ Balanced Output: Prevented whip switching from overlapping multiple attacks in a single animation cycle, resulting in more realistic and balanced DPS.

🐞 Bug Fixes:
Fixed an issue where whip switching could interrupt attacks and cause unintentional high DPS.

Fixed a problem where the mod would return to the main whip too early, before the sub whip’s buff was properly applied.
