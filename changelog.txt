Version 2.2.0 has been published to Stable tModLoader v2025.2

⚙️ 功能优化：
✅ Debuff 武器现在仅在完成一次攻击动画后自动切回原始武器，避免连续攻击或停留过长。

🐞 修复内容：
修复配置中包含已卸载模组的 debuff 武器时，导致整个 debuff 切换逻辑失效的问题。
修复打开背包时仍会切换到 debuff 武器的问题（主鞭与副鞭原本不受影响）。
修复在某些情况下主鞭使用时间较长，导致切入 debuff 后停留时间异常的问题。

-------------------------------------------------

⚙️ Improvements:
✅ Debuff weapons now switch back to the previous weapon immediately after completing one attack animation.

🐞 Bug Fixes:
Fixed an issue where having unloaded modded debuff weapons in the config would break all debuff switching.
Fixed an issue where debuff weapons could still switch in while the inventory was open (main and sub whips were not affected).
Fixed a timing issue where long main whip durations could cause debuff weapons to stay active longer than expected.
