Version 2.3.2 has been published to Stable tModLoader v2025.2

修复：连续点击或开关背包后，模组错误地将不在快捷栏中的武器视为初始武器的问题

优化：现在只有快捷栏中的武器才会被记录为初始武器，用于后续还原逻辑

现在每种主鞭类型只会轮换一次，即使有多个相同的武器也只使用其中一把

-------------------------------------------------

Fixed: Bug where weapons outside the hotbar could be incorrectly recorded as the initial weapon after rapid clicks or toggling the inventory

Improved: Only weapons in the hotbar are now eligible to be recorded as the initial weapon for later restoration

Now only one instance of each main whip type is used in the rotation, even if duplicates exist
